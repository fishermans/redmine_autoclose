= Redmine Autoclose plugin

Plugin automatially closes an issue that have been resolved but not closed
for a specified interval.

Works with Redmine 4.x, 3.x, 2.6, 2.4.

== Configuration

Plugin provides a settings page where one can specify:
* check interval - amount of days after which an issue is treated as stalled.
* comment text - comment posted to the issue.
* user - an user who posts notification. Admin by default.
* projects - a comma-separated list of project identifiers included with checking, or * for all projects.

== Launching

Plugin provides two rake tasks:
1. <tt>autoclose:autoclose</tt> - Plugin finds affected issues and updates them.

2. <tt>autoclose:preview</tt> - Plugin finds affected issues and prints them to STDERR without actual updating.

You can place into crontab something like that:

    0 1 * * * cd REDMINE_ROOT && bundle exec rake autoclose:autoclose RAILS_ENV=production
